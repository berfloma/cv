      "description": "Currently, I am part of the innovation team at Kenmei Technologies, working as a Data Scientist and implementing solutions to optimize DataOps workflows.\n\nPreviously, after completing my Master's degree in Civil Engineering, I worked for over three years as a transportation engineer and data scientist at CPS Infraestructuras, Movilidad y Medio Ambiente, conducting modeling, traffic, and mobility studies. During this period, I was able to implement new ways of working and develop new products (web requests, ETL processes, visualization, cloud...) focused on obtaining and exploiting new mobility data sources.\n\nRegarding my personal projects, I highlight that my continuous work in data analysis and my interests in statistics and programming led me to self-train in both data analysis and the Python programming language. These interests led me to continue my education until I completed a Master's degree in Big Data Analytics, where I learned to manage large volumes of data efficiently, as reflected in my final master's project \"Analysis and visualization of the impact of music festivals on Blablacar trips,\" which also won the second prize nationally in the Datathon Cajamar University Hack.",
